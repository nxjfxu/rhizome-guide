<h2>(Hyper)Link in Hormone</h2>
<p>In Hormone, you can create a link to another text using the '=&gt;' (link) function.
The following code creates a link to a fragment named 'somewhere-else'.</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>(=> "somewhere-else")</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div><a class="anchor" href="./../../somewhere-else.html">[somewhere-else]</a></div></div>
<p>There is also a convenient shortcut.
You can put the name of the text fragment to link to in square brackets,
and it would be equivalent to the one before:</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>[somewhere-else]</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div><a class="anchor" href="./../../somewhere-else.html">[somewhere-else]</a></div></div>
<p>To link to somewhere outside the Rhizome,
you can use '/&gt;', the generic URL link function:</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>(/> "https://example.com")</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div><a class="anchor" href="https://example.com"><[https://example.com]></a></div></div>
<p>Which is equivalent to:</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>[/> https://example.com]</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div><a class="anchor" href="https://example.com"><[https://example.com]></a></div></div>
<div class="note"><span class="block-title note-title">Note</span><span>You need to write the full URL, including the protocol
       ('https' in this example).</span></div>
<h2>Moving Information across Text Fragments</h2>
<p>It would be rather boring if the user can move between fragments,
but information, in the form of Hormone expressions, cannot.
Hormone allows information to flow across the border between text fragments
by first 'providing', and then 'requiring' them.</p>
<p>In <a class="anchor" href="./../../example/a-library.html">[example/a-library]</a>, there are the definitions of a few functions.
And then, the functions 'add-one' and 'add-two'
are 'provided' using the '~&gt;' (provide) function.
By 'providing' these two function, what it is saying is that
when another fragment 'requires' <a class="anchor" href="./../../example/a-library.html">[example/a-library]</a>,
it will get those two functions.</p>
<p>To 'require' another text fragment, you can use the '&lt;~' (require) function:</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>(<~ "example/a-library")</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div>
<p>Provided two functions: add-one and add-two.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="note"><span class="block-title note-title">Note</span><span>The above is equivalent to '[&lt;~ example/a-library]'</span></div>
<p>When you 'require' another fragment, that fragment is evaluated.
The evaluation result is returned by the 'require' function.</p>
<p>More importantly, the two functions 'provided' by <a class="anchor" href="./../../example/a-library.html">[example/a-library]</a>
are now available in this file:</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>(add-one 1)</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div>2</div></div>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>(add-two 1)</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div>3</div></div>
<p>The 'private-add-two' function, which is not 'provided',
is not available after we 'require':</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>(private-add-two 1)</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div><span class="error">!!( 'private-add-two' is undefined. )</span></div></div>
<p>Since 'requiring' a fragment also returns its evaluation result,
you can 'require' a fragment solely for its content,
even when it does not 'provide' anything.
Here, we are requiring the evaluation result from <a class="anchor" href="./../../example/to-be-required.html">[example/to-be-required]</a>:</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>(<~ "example/to-be-required")</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div>Hello!  One plus one is 2.  Link to the guide: <a class="anchor" href="./../guide.html">[guide]</a>.</div></div>
<p>As an example more representative of Hormone's typical uses,
we can require <a class="anchor" href="./../../example/a-thousand-plateaus.html">[example/a-thousand-plateaus]</a>,
a book object we used as an example in <a class="anchor" href="./../../guide/hormone.html">[guide/hormone]</a>,
to obtain the book as an object:</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>(<~ "example/a-thousand-plateaus")</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div><pre>~~BOOK~~

</pre></div></div></p>
<h3>Re-Providing Information</h3>
<p>If you have 'required' a fragment,
you can 'provide' everything you have 'required' from that fragment
using the '&gt;~&gt;' (re-provide) function:</p>
<div class="H"><pre class="H-code"><span class="H-title">Code</span>(>~> "example/a-library")</pre><span class="H-title">Result</span><div></div></div>
<p>Now, any other fragment that 'requires' this fragment (<a class="anchor" href="./../../guide/hormone/intertextuality.html">[guide/hormone/intertextuality]</a>)
will also 'require' everything we have required from <a class="anchor" href="./../../example/a-library.html">[example/a-library]</a>.</p>
<h3>The Prelude</h3>
<p>One of Rhizome's special fragments, the <em>prelude</em> (<a class="anchor" href="./../../.^.html">[.^]</a>),
is 'required' implicitly by every other fragment
at the beginning of its evaluation.
You never have to 'require' the prelude by yourself.
It is always available.</p>
<p>The prelude is a good place to 're-provide' things from other libraries.
This is the only thing we are doing in the prelude of this guide.</p>
<h3>'Requiring' for More than One Time</h3>
<p>You can 'require' the same fragment for more than one time.
However, when you 'require' it again, it will not be evaluated again.
Instead, the 'require' will return the same value you got last time.
The 'required' definitions will remain available.</p>
<p>Hormone makes sure that no fragment is evaluated more than once
when they are 'required'.
This is for performance reasons.
It is entirely possible that if you do evaluate the other fragment again,
you would get back another value,
but you should refrain from coding in that fashion.</p>

\[title Intertextuality in Hormone]

\[section (Hyper)Link in Hormone]

In Hormone, you can create a link to another text using the '=&gt;' (link) function.
The following code creates a link to a fragment named 'somewhere-else'.

\(~H #&quot;(=&gt; ~&quot;somewhere-else~&quot;)&quot;)

There is also a convenient shortcut.
You can put the name of the text fragment to link to in square brackets,
and it would be equivalent to the one before:

\(~H &quot;[somewhere-else]&quot;)

To link to somewhere outside the Rhizome,
you can use '/&gt;', the generic URL link function:

\(~H #&quot;(/&gt; ~&quot;https://example.com~&quot;)&quot;)

Which is equivalent to:

\(~H #&quot;[/&gt; https://example.com]&quot;)

\[note You need to write the full URL, including the protocol
       ('https' in this example).]


\[section Moving Information across Text Fragments]

It would be rather boring if the user can move between fragments,
but information, in the form of Hormone expressions, cannot.
Hormone allows information to flow across the border between text fragments
by first 'providing', and then 'requiring' them.

In \[example/a-library], there are the definitions of a few functions.
And then, the functions 'add-one' and 'add-two'
are 'provided' using the '~&gt;' (provide) function.
By 'providing' these two function, what it is saying is that
when another fragment 'requires' \[example/a-library],
it will get those two functions.

To 'require' another text fragment, you can use the '&lt;~' (require) function:

\(~H #&quot;(&lt;~~ ~&quot;example/a-library~&quot;)&quot;)

\(note &quot;The above is equivalent to '[&lt;~~ example/a-library]'&quot;)

When you 'require' another fragment, that fragment is evaluated.
The evaluation result is returned by the 'require' function.

More importantly, the two functions 'provided' by \[example/a-library]
are now available in this file:

\[~H (add-one 1)]
\[~H (add-two 1)]

The 'private-add-two' function, which is not 'provided',
is not available after we 'require':

\[~H (private-add-two 1)]

Since 'requiring' a fragment also returns its evaluation result,
you can 'require' a fragment solely for its content,
even when it does not 'provide' anything.
Here, we are requiring the evaluation result from \[example/to-be-required]:

\(~H #&quot;(&lt;~~ ~&quot;example/to-be-required~&quot;)&quot;)

As an example more representative of Hormone's typical uses,
we can require \[example/a-thousand-plateaus],
a book object we used as an example in \[guide/hormone],
to obtain the book as an object:

\(~H #&quot;(&lt;~~ ~&quot;example/a-thousand-plateaus~&quot;)&quot;)

\[subsection Re-Providing Information]

If you have 'required' a fragment,
you can 'provide' everything you have 'required' from that fragment
using the '&gt;~&gt;' (re-provide) function:

\(~H #&quot;(&gt;~~&gt; ~&quot;example/a-library~&quot;)&quot;)

Now, any other fragment that 'requires' this fragment (\(=&gt; ~.))
will also 'require' everything we have required from \[example/a-library].

\[subsection The Prelude]

One of Rhizome's special fragments, the \[emph prelude] (\[.^]),
is 'required' implicitly by every other fragment
at the beginning of its evaluation.
You never have to 'require' the prelude by yourself.
It is always available.

The prelude is a good place to 're-provide' things from other libraries.
