<p><em>Hormone</em> is the scripting language Rhizome uses for processing text fragment.
Every time a Rhizome fragment is accessed,
its textual content is executed as a Hormone script,
and the execution result is displayed on the webpage.</p>

<h2>A Quick Glance at Hormone</h2>
<p>In text fragments, Hormone scripts start with a '\', the backslash symbol.
This tells the Hormone interpreter to evaluate the content after the backslash
as a Hormone expression, rather than regular text.
For example, if you write '\(+ 1 1)' in your text,
it will be treated as a mathematical operation rather than text,
and will look like '2'.</p>
<div class="note"><span class="block-title note-title">Note</span><span>Go to the source of this page and see what that '2'
       above actually is.</span></div>
<p>One of the most important use of Hormone is to create links.
For example, writing in your text \[link-target]
creates a link to a fragment named 'link-target',
like this: <a class="anchor" href="./../link-target.html">[link-target]</a>.
This allows text fragments to be weaved into <em>hypertext</em>.</p>
<p>You can also use Hormone script to format your text.
For example, \[emph italic] makes text <em>italic</em>.</p>
<p>However, Hormone can do much more than that.
As an object-oriented language, you can represent various 'items'
as objects, and reuse them efficiently across multiple text fragments.</p>
<p>For example, you can define an object prototype
for books (see <a class="anchor" href="./../example/book.html">[example/book]</a>),
and define the book 'A Thousand Plateaus'
as an object (see <a class="anchor" href="./../example/a-thousand-plateaus.html">[example/a-thousand-plateaus]</a>).
You can then reference the book by 'requiring' the book object,
by writing \[&lt;~ example/a-thousand-plateaus].
The result would look like:</p>
<pre>~~BOOK~~
-
- A Thousand Plateaus
- By: Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari 1980

~ S:<a class="anchor" href="./../example/a-thousand-plateaus.html">[example/a-thousand-plateaus]</a>
</pre>
<p>This is how this book, as an object, is shown when it appears in text.
However, you can also render it in a short way:</p>
<p>Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari [1980] A Thousand Plateaus  =&gt; <a class="anchor" href="./../example/a-thousand-plateaus.html">[example/a-thousand-plateaus]</a></p>
<p>Or even extract a bibtex entry from it:</p>
<pre>@book{example/a-thousand-plateaus,
  title=&quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot;,
  author=&quot;Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari&quot;,
  year=&quot;1980&quot;
}
</pre>
<p>There are, of course, many more ways to use Hormone in your text.
You may have noticed the navigation bar at the top and bottom
of each guide page, with links to the previous and next guide page.
That is also an object!
The navigation bar changes its form according the guide page it is in.
You can find its definition in <a class="anchor" href="./../guide/table-of-contents.html">[guide/table-of-contents]</a>.
(The table of contents itself is an object.)</p>
<p>In Rhizome, text flow freely across fragments.
With Hormone, text is always in a state of flux,
always undergoing changes, never complete.
This is Rhizome/Hormone's philosophy.</p>

\[emph Hormone] is the scripting language Rhizome uses for processing text fragment.
Every time a Rhizome fragment is accessed,
its textual content is executed as a Hormone script,
and the execution result is displayed on the webpage.

\[section A Quick Glance at Hormone]

In text fragments, Hormone scripts start with a '\\\\', the backslash symbol.
This tells the Hormone interpreter to evaluate the content after the backslash
as a Hormone expression, rather than regular text.
For example, if you write '\\\\(+ 1 1)' in your text,
it will be treated as a mathematical operation rather than text,
and will look like '\(+ 1 1)'.

\[note Go to the source of this page and see what that '2'
       above actually is.]

One of the most important use of Hormone is to create links.
For example, writing in your text \\\\[link-target]
creates a link to a fragment named 'link-target',
like this: \[link-target].
This allows text fragments to be weaved into \[emph hypertext].

You can also use Hormone script to format your text.
For example, \\\\[emph italic] makes text \[emph italic].

However, Hormone can do much more than that.
As an object-oriented language, you can represent various 'items'
as objects, and reuse them efficiently across multiple text fragments.

For example, you can define an object prototype
for books (see \[example/book]),
and define the book 'A Thousand Plateaus'
as an object (see \[example/a-thousand-plateaus]).
You can then reference the book by 'requiring' the book object,
by writing \\\\[&lt;~ example/a-thousand-plateaus].
The result would look like:

\[&lt;~ example/a-thousand-plateaus]

This is how this book, as an object, is shown when it appears in text.
However, you can also render it in a short way:

\(-&gt; [&lt;~ example/a-thousand-plateaus] ~inline)

Or even extract a bibtex entry from it:
