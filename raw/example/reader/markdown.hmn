#~ ~markdown

# Markdown Example

This is a **markdown** file.
Text in this file is rendered as _markdown_ text.

You still need to use '\\\\' for *Hormone* expressions.

'~markdown' does not call the typesetter method of objects:

\[<~ example/a-thousand-plateaus]

... therefore, '~markdown' is more useful as building block for other readers.
